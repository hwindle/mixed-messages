#Mixed Animal Messages

This project uses Git, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, the BASH prompt, and HTML/CSS to make a small webpage with random animal messages.

##Input
A large 'new message' button towards the bottom of the page to change the message.

##Output
`This is a {animal} eating some {food} and feeling {mood}`
Picture of the animal in question to match the text. Use old school emoticons as the last word after 'mood'.
